      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Joaquin Maravillo Arguello, I am a first year web developer. I made the decision to change career paths because I feel more passionate about web development, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This new career path offers me various opportunities to succeed and broaden my knowledge. I feel like i've outgrown my current career, which is what helped lead me into this new change. Im very optimistic and excited for what is to come and all the future possibilities.  </p>
