        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Joaquin Maravillo Arguello, I am a first year web developer. I made the decision to change career
          paths because I feel more passionate about web development, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This new career path
          offers me various opportunities to succeed and broaden my knowledge. I feel like i've outgrown my current
          career, which is what helped lead me into this new change. Im very optimistic and excited for what is to come
          and all the future possibilities. </p>
